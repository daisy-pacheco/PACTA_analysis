--------------
	\textbf{This report provides a 2°C scenario analysis of your financial portfolio.} 
	
	It responds to the recommendations of the G20's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Over 1,000 financial institutions have been assessed using the model applied in this report, as part of direct partnerships with over 200 institutional investors, and collaborations with  a number of financial supervisory authorities. 
	
	The outputs provided in this report – based on the scope of analysis summarized in the table on the right – provide an analysis of the portfolio relative to an economic transition consistent with limiting global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, as well as a comparision to peers. The analysis provides answers to three questions: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{What is my exposure to economic activities exposured to the transition to a low-carbon economy today?}
		\item{Is my portfolio building or reducing risk in terms of being aligned / misaligned with a 2°C transition over the next 5 years?}
		\item{What is my expected transition risk exposure?}
	\end{enumerate}
	

--------------
	Of your investments, this analysis is limited to specific security types and sectors that are both climate relevant and have sufficiently granular scenario data. Equity, corporrate bonds and the bonds of the largest government and municipal power producers from your investments are included in this analysis (see graph bottom left), and for the purposes of this report this subset of your total investments is referred to as "your portfolio".  Of your portfolio, the fossil fuel, power, and automotive sectors are analyzed (see graph bottom right). This chart shows the percentage of your analyzed portfolio within these sectors, seperated by fixed income and equity portfolios' as applicable.

	\textbf{The figure below shows the 2023 alignment of your portfolio in the covered technologies compared to a market portfolio which represents the 2° Market Benchmark.}
	
	A negative  percentage, a bar below the line, indicates that your portfolio is not aligned with the with the 2° Benchmark.  For technologies that the IEA scenario specifies should decrease over the next 5 years ("brown" technologies), this means that your portfolio has more exposure than specificed by the 2° scenario; for technologies that the scenario says should increase ("green" technologies) a negative percentage means that your portfolio is underexposed relative to the  2° Benchmark .

	A positive percentage, a bar above the line, indicates that your portfolio is aligned with the 2° Benchmark. For technologies that the IEA scenario specifies should decrease over the next 5 years, this means that your portfolio has less exposure than specificed by the 2° scenario; for technologies that the scenario says should increase, a positive  percentage means your portfolio has more exposure than the 2° Benchmark.

--------------

	\textbf{This report provides a 2°C scenario analysis of your equity and fixed income portfolios, following the recommendations of the G20's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Specifically, it seeks to inform the reader about four issues.}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{\textbf{What is the current exposure of my portfolio to the 2°C scenario and transition risk? (Section 2)}
		}
		
		The first part of the report summarizes the exposures of the portfolio (in terms of \% of the portfolio) to business activities potentially affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy and by extension more broadly its exposure to transition risk. Specifically, it will quantify the percent of the portfolio that can be included in 2°C scenario analysis, the relative exposure to low-carbon and high-carbon fuels and technologies across the energy, power, and automobile sector, as well as the application of the Moody’s environmental risk assessment framework on the fixed income portfolio. The analysis will also benchmark the results compared to the peers included in this assessment and a market portfolio.
		
		\item{\textbf{Is my portfolio building or reducing risk in terms of being aligned / misaligned with a 2°C transition over the next 5 years? (Section 3)}
		}
		
		The second part of the report will quantify the extent to which the portfolio is building or reducing risk in terms of being aligned / misaligned with the 2°C scenario pathway over the next 5 years across key business activities. The analysis will focus on the fossil fuel related sectors in terms of energy (oil production, gas production), electric power (coal power, gas power, nuclear power, renewables power), and automobile (Internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles). The analysis will currently planned production / investment trend in the portfolio with the production / investment that would be requried under the 2°C scenario. 
		
		\item{\textbf{What is my expected alignment in 5 five years? (Section 4)}
		}
		
		The third part of the report will quantify the extent to which your portfolio's currently planned production / investments until 2023 over- or under-weight high-carbon and low-carbon technologies, relative to a market portfolio in alignment with the 2° benchmark.
		
		\item{\textbf{What is driving the results? (Section 5)}}
		
		The final section will provide some more granular information on the companies behind the securities in your portfolio and the extent to which they are driving the results.
		
		You will also be able to find further background information on the scenarios and modelling at the end of the report.

	--------------
	
		
		\textbf{This page provides information on the exposure of the portfolio to business activities covered in 2°C scenarios. }
		
		These business activities account for roughly 70-90\% of GHG emissions in the typical investor portfolio. The figure on the right shows the percent of the portfolio (by asset class) exposed to the fossil fuels, power, and automotive sectors. The figures below show the weight of each technology/fuel within each sector, by asset class. The graphs below highlight the relative weight of high-carbon and low-carbon technologies within each sector.  For context, the results for a portfolio of peer companies and the relevant stock or bond market is also included in this analysis.

	--------------
		\textbf{This page provides information on the comparison of the exposure of the portfolio to transition risk among California insurance companies.}
		
		It takes the information from the previous page and contextualizes it relative to the other California insurance companies covered under this assessment. More specifically it compares the distribution of fossil fuel exposure within all portfolios. The results show that for fixed income portfolios no portfolio has an exposure to fossil fuels greater than 10\% For equity portfolios, the distribution is greater ranging from 0\% exposure to 100\% exposure.

\HeaderSingle{ENVIRONMENTAL RISK CURRENT EXPOSURE – FIXED INCOME}	

	--------------
		\textbf{For the fixed income portfolios, Moody’s has developed an environmental risk sector classification that goes beyond climate to a broader suite of environmental risks.} 
		
		The classification – developed in 2015 / 2016 – has been previously applied by a range of insurance companies and supervisors to identify risk exposures. Moody’s creates a risk level for each debt based on the sector in which they operate.  These ratings are based on sectoral breakdown. 
		
		\textbf{The following four risk levels are represented in the classification:  }

	\end{center}
	
	--------------
		\textbf{The following chart presents the percentage of your portfolio by AUM that is rated as Immediate Elevated, Emerging Elevated or Emerging Moderate.} 
		
		While there is some variation, almost all Californian investors, have some exposure to sectors of elevated risk. While this is primarily only in emerging elevated sectors, it gives an indication that the invested bond market is quite exposed to risk. 
		
		The portfolio is above the average in terms of environmental risk exposure, the average being 11\%. Crucially, the assessment provided here does not build on the 	type of granularity described earlier in terms of high-carbon and low-carbon exposures, but remains at sector level. It is thus by design more imprecise than alternative approaches.

	\textbf{The alignment graphs below show the alignment of selected power technologies in your fixed income portfolio relative to the IEA scenarios for 2°C, 4°C and 6°C temperature change, the global bond universe and the average of your peers.} 
	
	These charts present the trajectory of buildout in the power sector for the companies with production within your fixed income portfolio. This has been normalized to the 2°C benchmark, so the plotted lines show the difference to a 2°C scenario outcome. This is overlayed over the different IEA scenarios for these technologies, represented by the shaded background. This shows how the buildout of capacity allocated to your portfolio is aligned to the scenarios.  The forward-looking estimates for your portfolio are based on asset-level data analysis by sector and technology provided by GlobalData for the power and fossil fuel sector, and WardsAuto / AutoForecastSolutions for the automobile sector. Further background information on the data sources can be found in Section 5. 
	
	\textbf{The alignment graphs below show the alignment of selected fossil fuels and automobile technologies in your equity portfolio relative to the IEA scenarios for 2°C, 4°C and 6°C temperature change, the global stock market and the average of your peers. } 
	
	The page brings together data on the upstream supply of fossil fuels and the largest downstream user of oil, namely the automotive sector. It highlights the extent to which within a portfolio the strategies across sectors may be more or less consistent, relative to a 2°C scenario.

	--------------
		\textbf{The figure below shows the estimated exposure of your equity portfolio in 2023 to the technologies and fuels in the climate relevant sectors covered in this analysis. }
		
		The results are a function both of the starting point of the exposure (Section 2) and the evolution of the exposure over time (Section 3) based on current revealed investment and production plans for all technologies. The results show the relative exposure of your portfolios across asset classes and technologies / fuels. They should be interpreted as follows:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{0\% alignment suggests the portfolio weights the respective technology / fuel identically to the market in 2023 – freezing both the current portfolio exposure and the current revealed production / investment plans of companies within those portfolios.}
			
			\item{Any figure above 0\% suggests that the portfolio ‘exceeds’ the expected market exposure under a 2°C transition. This implies a higher exposure to low-carbon technologies and a lower exposure to high-carbon technologies. Thus, a figure of 10\% for oil production implies an under-weight of oil production relative to the benchmark by 10\%. }

		The blue circle represents the alignment of your portfolio in that technology as compared to the benchmark. The black dashed line represents the distribution of 50\% of your peers, with the white circle representing the average of all portfolios.

		Wood Mackenzie (2018) propose that while shifting away from high-carbon fuels towards low carbon is necessary, within the oil and gas industry, shifting away from particular extraction methods is a transitional alternative. This report does not comment on the emissions by extraction type however data is available on this. Companies need to look beyond resource themes and review the variations in upstream emissions intensity to see how companies can reduce their CO\textsubscript{2} footprints. Even assets of the same theme can have significantly different emissions intensity based upon maturity, location and other unique factors.

		An alternative assessment of oil companies can be made by comparing the share of oil reserves owned by a company to production that would be outside the 2°C pathway. This is allocated based on the cost curves of oil production, where future production is distributed according to the ‘least-cost principle’.
		On this basis, the share of reserves/future production which is outside the 2°C path is determined. This share is the sum of the future oil production that is above the 2°C price limit, where existing reserves are exhausted. The graph below shows the results for the largest oil and gas companies in your portfolio (across asset classes).
		
		This research was conducted by the Carbon Tracker Initiative. This organisation uses similar asset level databases to compare cost curves to the company production.

\HeaderSingle{BACKGROUND TO THE MODEL}

--------------
\textbf{Background.} In June 2017, the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommended that financial institutions perform scenario analysis on their portfolios to assess financial risks related to climate change. The TCFD grouped climate-related risks into two categories: physical and transition risks. Transition risks are risks generated by the policy, technology, market, and regulatory changes likely to accompany the transition to a low carbon economy. As part of its supervisory role, the California Department of Insurance engaged the 2° Investing Initiative (2Dii) to undertake a scenario analysis of the investment portfolios of insurance companies operating in California with more than \$100 million in premiums.

\textbf{Goal.} The goal of the scenario analysis was to assess California insurers’ exposure to transition risk, individually and as a whole, based on the evolution of production and assets in the real economy. This analysis compares the currently planned production from physical assets allocated to a portfolio (for example, the projected number of barrels of oil produced by an oil well owned by a company that has issued a security held in an insurer’s portfolio) with future production levels defined in a 2°C scenario. To ensure comparability across results, this analysis uses the ‘Energy Technology roadmaps‘ published by the International Energy Agency (IEA). See the ‘Important Considerations and Limitations‘ section at the end of this page for notes on interpreting these scenarios.

\textbf{Portfolios.} Data on insurers’ investments was taken from the 2016 year end financial filings of all insurers operating in California with more than \$100 million premiums, yielding a sample of 672 insurers with over \$4 trillion in investments, the bulk of which - nearly 87\% - is held in fixed-income portfolios. This analysis is based on the composition of the insurers’ portfolios at the end of year 2016 assuming no change in portfolio composition.

\textbf{Scenarios.} The IEA’s 450 Scenario (450S) is the most well know climate scenario globally. It defines how climate-relevant technologies - essentially energy technologies - must be deployed by 2050 to reach a 50\% probability of limiting warming to 2°C or 3.6°F. In addition to the 450S, the IEA also defines the New Policies Scenario (NPS) and Current Policies Scenario (CPS): other technology roadmaps that correspond to a 50\% probability of maximum 4°C and 6°C warming, respectively. The 450S (also referred as “2° scenario”), NPS (“4° scenario”), and CPS (“6° scenario”) all provide forward-looking projections with enough regional detail to perform scenario analysis for 11 technologies in 3 sectors. The analysis is based on the IEA scenarios for the California Department of Insurance and covers fossil fuel extraction (oil, gas, and coal mining); production of electricity (from coal, gas, petrol, hydro, nuclear, and renewables); and, the production of cars (internal combustion engines - gasoline and diesel, hybrid, and electric).

\textbf{Methodology.} The key elements of the analysis are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textit{Projecting investments and producton.} Projected producton (for Fossil Fuels and Automotive) and new capacity (for Utilities) for the next 5 years was sourced from commercial business intelligence databases. These data providers collect production capacity, forecasts, and investment data at the most granular level, including barrels of oil by field, cars by model and factory, new capacity by power plant. 2Dii maps these data to their immediate owners, and then their parent company to generate the company’s aggregate ‘current production profile’ for each technology, and links those production plans to the financial securities (stocks and corporate bonds) issued by the company. The asset-level data used for this analysis was retrieved from data providers during the first half of 2017. See the ‘Important Considerations and Limitations‘ section at the end of this page for notes on interpreting power sector capacity data.}
	
	\item{\textit{Allocating physical asset production to financial assets.} Based on the share of total equity or debt held in a portfolio, the model allocates a portion of each corporate issuer’s current production plans for each technology to the portfolio. Aggregated to the portfolio level, this is the ‘portfolios’ current production profile’ for a technology. This also defines the insurer’s current ‘exposure’ to each technology.}
	
	\item{\textit{From macro-level scenario to micro-level targets. }To calculate production levels consistent with a climate scenario such as the IEA 2°C scenario, the model uses a ‘fair share’ principle that applies the changes specified by the scenario for a given technology and region equally across all owners of physical assets in that region. It creates a set of alternative production profiles ‘under the scenario’, or consistent with the scenario, for each technology and company. These alternative production profiles are then aggregated to the portfolio level to create the portfolio’s production profile under the scenario. This profile is used to determine the ‘insurer’s target exposure’ to a technology under the scenario. The ‘target exposure’ does not assume any change in the composition of the portfolio: it models the changes in production and investment plans that are required across the different companies held, in order to match the technology deployment roadmap.}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assessing Alignment with a 2°C Transition Pathway. }This analysis assesses the level of alignment with a 2°C transition pathway, using two references:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textit{The portfolio's ‘own’ 2°C target.} This is the portfolio‘s target production profile ‘under the 2° scenario’: the changes required in the production profile of the companies held in the portfolio, in order to meet the target, based on the above-described methodology. While the 2°C scenario is the focus of this analysis, the target profiles for a 4°C and a 6°C scenario are also calculated to provide further context. Since the securities held and their weight in the portfolio are identical for the portfolio and its alternative versions, comparing them shows how aligned or misaligned the current production profiles of companies held in the portfolio are with each scenario.}
	
	\item{\textit{The 2°C benchmark. }This is the target production profile of a ‘market benchmark’ under the 2° scenario. The same principle as described above is applied to a ‘benchmark portfolio’: the stock market as a whole, or the corporate bond market as a whole. Since the securities and their weight in the market portfolio differ from those in the portfolio, this comparison highlights ‘idiosyncratic’ alignment or misalignment. In other words, it shows how the current composition of the portfolio affects the alignment with the different scenarios, when the first reference only stresses the changes requested from the companies.}
\end{itemize}


The alignment or misalignment of a portfolio’s production and exposure to each technology relative to a scenario is one way to better understand insurers’ exposure to energy transition risk. If policy, technology, market, or regulatory changes occur to bring the global real economy in line with the 2°C scenario, misalignment in a given technology would likely change the financial returns associated with those underlying physical assets. However, this analysis only assesses one dimension of energy transition risks: the assets at risk in the real economy. It does not take into account the financial resilience of the company to those changes and its capacity to adapt, which would require further financial analysis.

\textbf{Important Considerations and Limitations when Interpreting these Results}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textit{Stringency of scenarios.} The use of a given scenario (2°C, 4°C, and 6°C) does not constitute an assumption that this scenario is more likely to prevail than others. Similarly, the choice of IEA scenarios should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the underlying assumptions by 2Dii or the California Department of Insurance. The IEA historically has assumed significant amounts of nuclear power and carbon capture and storage in their scenarios, an assumption that is debated within the energy-climate scientific community. In addition, the international community has accelerated their global target from the 2°C goal to “well below 2°C and towards 1.5°C“. It is important to highlight that each insurer can and may want to take an individual view on the likely decarbonization scenario that may or may not relate to the scenarios modelled by the International Energy Agency.}
	
	\item{\textit{A snapshot rather than forecasts.} The forward-looking production data is based on current ‘revealed’ plans from companies, and is subject to change. The estimates should thus not be interpreted as forecasts, but rather as the current plans of companies as estimated from various sources of information by industry-specific business intelligence experts - who might not know everything about the CEOs’ actual plans. Given the 5 year time horizon, it is likely that these plans will change in some way over time. Similarly, insurers are highly likely to alter the composition of their portfolio over time. Bond maturity is usually around 3-7 years. The average holding period of a stock by a fund manager is 20 months on average. However, this analysis seeks to be a point in time assessment of future exposures under current conditions.}
	
	\item{\textit{Power sector projections.} This is a measure of "locked-in" capacity, not a capacity forecast. Distinct from the production data for the Fossil Fuel and Automotive sectors, capacity data for the Power sector does not include information on planned retirements. It should therefore be interpreted as a measure of currently "locked-in" capacity and not as a forecast of future capacity. Retirements are not included for several reasons: First, the availability of planned retirement data is highly variable across jurisdictions and regions, to the extent that including no retirement information was deemed more representative of indutry capacity than including partial data. Second, in contrast to the fossil fuel sector where oil wells, gas fields, and coal mines cease production when their resource runs out, it is possible for power plants to be announced as retired or even be retired and then resume production. Given the higher level of uncertainty around planned retirements, they are not included in the power sector projections used for this analysis, and capacity projections should thus be interpreted as the potential maximum “lock-in“ from current infrastructure. For technologies projected to decline under the 2° scenario, the gap between current capacity projections and capacity consistent with the 2° scenario should be seen as an estimate of the capacity that would need to be retired to be in alignment with the 2° scenario.} 
\end{itemize}

\section*{} %BACKGROUND TO THE MODEL
\HeaderSingle{BACKGROUND TO THE MODEL}

	--------------
		\textbf{The objective of the assessment framework applied in this scenario analysis is to measure the alignment of financial portfolios with 2°C decarbonisation pathways. The model consists of 3 key elements that are detailed in the following pages.}
		
		
		\begin{itemize}
			
			\item {Scenarios, notably 2°C scenarios, that form the basis of the analysis and define the benchmark against which portfolio trends are compared. While in theory a range of scenarios can be applied for the model, in the interest of simplification, this analysis will rely on the scenarios of the International Energy Agency. These provide targets for each technology at a regional level. }
			
			\item{Financial portfolios and associated financial data to allow for the portfolio assessment. Within this report, the analysis will be limited to fixed income and equity portfolio. Funds within your portfolio have been identified and the underlying financial data extracted from Morningstar and included as part of your portfolio. }
			
			\item{Physical / industry ‘asset level data’ (current and forward looking) is mapped to companies, parents, and securities. This allows the link between financial portfolios  and industry and production data (oil and gas production, automotive production, utilities) to be established. Consequently, this allows a comparison to the 2°C scenarios and a corresponding evaluation of the alignment of the portfolio. }
			
		\end{itemize}

	\includegraphics[trim = {0 0cm 0 0},width=1\linewidth]{ReportGraphics/SummaryChart}
	
	--------------
		\textbf{Allocation Rules}
		Based on the financial data, the asset level data is allocated to your portfolio to quantify a representative value of what your portfolio physically owns.  This allocation rules varies between equity and fixed income portfolios. For equity portfolios, the analysis is based on the ownership percentage of companies and their subsidiaries, with respect to all outstanding shares of the companies. This approach reflects the fact that the shares represent ownership ratios. In the case of debt, exposure is determined based on the share in the portfolio of the relevant credit instrument. The underlying company exposure is defined by the technology mix (for example, the ratio of renewable to coal power). 
		
		\textbf{Benchmarking}
		Using the allocated production or capacity of technologies within your portfolio in as a starting point, an allowance based on the regional scenarios is calculated. This is extrapolated over the next 5 years to create the trajectory and this is compared to your current and future ownership. The variation of your ownership from this benchmark is used as the alignment indicator in the preceding results.

				\textbf{Scenarios}
		
		The IEA’s 450 Scenario (450S) is the most well know climate scenario globally. It defines how climate-relevant technologies - essentially energy technologies - must be deployed by 2050 to reach a 50\% probability of limiting warming to 2°C or 3.6°F. In addition to the 450S, the IEA also defines the New Policies Scenario (NPS) and Current Policies Scenario (CPS): other technology roadmaps that correspond to a 50\% probability of maximum 4°C and 6°C warming, respectively. The 450S (also referred as “2° scenario”), NPS (“4° scenario”), and CPS (“6° scenario”) all provide forward-looking projections with enough regional detail to perform scenario analysis for 11 technologies in 3 sectors. The analysis is based on the IEA scenarios for the California Department of Insurance and covers fossil fuel extraction (oil, gas, and coal mining); production of electricity (from coal, gas, petrol, hydro, nuclear, and renewables); and, the production of cars (internal combustion engines - gasoline and diesel, hybrid, and electric).
		
		The IEA historically has assumed significant amounts of nuclear power and carbon capture and storage in their scenarios. In addition, the international community has accelerated their global target from the 2°C goal to well below 2°C with a target of 1.5°C. It is important to highlight that each investor can and may want to take an individual view on the likely decarbonization scenario that may or may not relate to the scenarios modelled by the International Energy Agency or others.
		
		The model uses the following indicators from the International Energy Agency scenario against which the portfolio is compared:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Electric capacity by fuel expressed in MW (e.g. renewables, coal, gas, oil, hydropower, nuclear);}
			\item{Oil production expressed in barrels of oil produced / year;}
			\item{Gas production expressed in bcf / year;}
			\item{Coal produced expressed in mtoe / year;}
			\item{GHG emissions pathways in a sample of additional sectors (e.g. aviation, shipping, cement, steel).}
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		\textbf{Asset Level Data}
		
		The Asset Level data is sourced from the following data providers: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{GlobalData (Power plant data, including plants classified as active, announced, financed, partially active, permitting, temporarily shutdown, under construction, under rehabilitation and modernization, and Oil and Gas production data and forecast until 2018-2023, as well as coal mining data); }
			\item{WardsAuto (light passenger duty vehicle, including BAU production forecasts 2018-2023); }
			\item{Bloomberg (financial data);}
			\item{Orbis (database on matching company subsidiary trees);}
			\item{S\&P Cross-Reference Services (database matching securities to parents);}
			\item{Morningstar (database on funds). }
			
		\end{itemize}
		
		\textbf{Caveats / Notes on interpreting the results}
		
		The following briefly highlights key caveats to the model and the results:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{The forward-looking data is based on current ‘revealed’ plans from companies and is subject to change. The estimates should thus not be interpreted as final forecasts, but rather the current plans of companies if they don’t change. Another way to interpret the results is the call for action with regard to the required change to align with the 2°C economic trend. Given the 5 year time horizon, there is a high degree of certainty that plans will still change in some way over time. Similarly, the participating financial institutions can of course alter their portfolio exposures over time. The analysis however seeks to be a point in time assessment of future exposures under current conditions.}
			\item{The model takes a diversified ‘market portfolio’ as a basis, focusing on key technologies reflected in the IEA roadmaps. By extension, thematic portfolios invested in breakthrough technologies and / or SRI portfolios with a range of environmental, social, and governmental considerations may not value these elements.}

\section*{} %INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RISK
\HeaderSingle{INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RISK}
	
	--------------
			Important in the implementation of different actions based on the 2°C scenario analysis is an understanding of the implications for risk and return of the portfolio. It is important to emphasize here that the results presented in this report are explicitly not a risk analysis. In general, the following findings can be summarized as the interaction between risk, return, and the 2°C scenario analysis. 
		
		\textbf{What is the risk of inaction?}
		Although the analysis focuses on alignment with the Paris Agreement in a way that contributes to the general interest, the issue can also be addressed in terms of the financial risk to the investor if the energy transition is not properly anticipated. 
		
		For investors, the main risk seems to be more pronounced if the 2°C target is not reached. Aviva and the Economist Intelligence Unit analyzed the net impairment loss for financial assets under management at approximately USD60 trillion in a 2°C scenario (Aviva 2015). The TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) initiated by the Financial Stability Committee (FSB) calls these risks ”physical risks”. If the 2°C objective is achieved, these physical risks can be reduced considerably. The cost would be limited to less than USD10 trillion if we remain below 3°C according to the same Aviva / ECIU estimates. 
		
		However, investment portfolios can then be exposed to what the TCFD calls ”transition risks” - the economic and financial risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. These risks are likely to be particularly pronounced for the most CO\textsubscript{2}-emitting sectors, and thus their investors. Most of these sectors are covered by our analysis in the previous sections. 
		
		Although the 2°C scenario presented in this report is not directly a financial risk assessment, it can help to better understand the exposure to transition risk faced by investors. It makes it possible to understand whether the necessary transition will be gradual (when the production and investment plans are aligned with the 2°C scenario) or is likely to be abrupt (sudden correction linked to the introduction of new technologies or constraints legal proceedings leading to bankruptcies of established companies). All investment strategies are exposed to potential risks. The scenario analysis reveals how each strategy evaluated is an explicit or implicit bet on a 2°C, 4°C or 6°C scenario. Depending on the trajectory that will ultimately prevail, the portfolios will underperform or outperform. From the point of view of the optimization of the risk/return ratio in the long term, it is essential to be aware of the bet made.
		
		From a transition risk perspective, the following three questions are important:
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{Is my portfolio over-exposed to transition risks by deviating from the 2°C benchmark?}
			\item{If this is the case, which securities in my portfolio are exposed to these risks?}
			\item{Should these risks arise, what are possible losses?}
		\end{enumerate}
		
		
		The answer to the first question is provided by the analysis presented in the previous pages. There are different approaches to quantifying exposure:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Based on the method presented in this report, it is possible to isolate the most misaligned sectors and securities with respect to a 2°C trajectory.}
			
			\item{The rating agency Moody’s developed in 2016 a methodology to classify the different sectors of their bond universe according to the risk of downgrade due to environmental risk.}
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		\textbf{Asset Pricing and Risk} 
		A final question to be considered is: what is the potential value at risk within the climate relevant sectors if a 2° C scenario materializes? This requires additional financial analysis. In particular, assumptions must be made as to how the market has already (or not) integrated these risks into the current price of financial assets. There are several research papers on the subject, published by financial analysts, NGOs and consultants, covering equities and credit (2ii 2018). 
		
		In all this, it is important to emphasize that asset prices - based on market participants’ assumptions about changes in the yield-risk profile of securities - do not necessarily reflect the economic risks faced by a company. Thus, the price of assets , and the risk that their valuation will decrease, does not automatically reflect the underlying risks to which the companies are exposed. On the other hand, it should be noted that the return potential is optimized when the allocation of capital is as efficient as possible. If the capital is not allocated efficiently, the absolute benefit is also reduced. Signals issued by the financial markets in the form of portfolio reallocation choices or via shareholder engagement can thus help optimize the allocation of capital in the real economy, and help maximize long-term returns.
