	\begin{multicols}{2}
		\textbf{This report provides a scenario analysis of the investment portfolio.} 
		
		It responds in part to the recommendations of the G20 Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Over 1,000 financial institutions have been assessed using the model applied in this report, as part of direct partnerships with over 200 institutional investors, and collaborations with a number of financial supervisors. 
		
		The outputs provided in this report provide an analysis of the portfolio relative to an economic transition consistent with limiting global warming to ScenarioTemp\degree C above pre-industrial levels, as well as a comparison to peers. The analysis provides answers to three questions: 
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{What is the current exposure in the portfolio to economic activities affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy? (Section 2)}
			\item{Does the portfolio increase or decrease its alignment with a ScenarioName transition over the next 5 years? (Section 3)}
			\item{What is the expected future exposure to high- and low-carbon economic activities? (Section 4)}
		\end{enumerate}
		
		This report considers a ScenarioValue transition. ScenarioDescription The analysis covers two asset classes: listed equity and corporate bonds. These are compared to either an portfolio or market, as if they would transition aligned to the ScenarioValue. The equity market is represented by all securities from publicaly listed companies and the corporate bond market by all companies with outstanding debt from Bloomberg at the end of 2017. \columnbreak

		The analysis focuses on climate relevant sectors. Scenario analysis is undertaken for the fossil fuel, power, and automotive sectors: these account for between 70 and 90\% of energy-related CO\textsubscript{2} -emissions in a typical equity portfolio. An analysis of the emissions intensity of the aviation, shipping, cement and steel sectors is also included in this report.

		\textbf{This report provides a scenario analysis, following part of the recommendations of the G20's Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Specifically, it seeks to inform the reader about four issues.}
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{\textbf{What is the current exposure of the portfolio to economic activities affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy? (Section 2) }
			}
			
			The first part of the report summarizes the exposures of the portfolio (in terms of \% of the portfolio) to business activities potentially affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy and by extension to transition risk. Specifically, it will quantify the percent of the portfolio exposed to low-carbon and high-carbon activities across the fossil fuel, power, and automotive sectors. The results will be presented relative to the market.
			
			\item{\textbf{Does the portfolio increase or decrease its alignment to the ScenarioValue over the next 5 years? (Section 3)}
			}
			
			The second part of the report will quantify the extent to which the portfolio is building or reducing risk in terms of being aligned / misaligned with the ScenarioValue pathway over the next 5 years. The analysis will focus on technologies in the fossil fuel sector (oil production, gas production, coal mining), electric power sector (coal power, gas power, nuclear power, renewables power), and automotive sector (internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles). Additionally, information is provided regarding the necessary progression of carbon emission intensity for the aviation, shipping, cement and steel sectors compared to Energy Technology Perspectives scenarios from the IEA. 
			
			\item{\textbf{What is the expected future exposure to high- and low-carbon economic activities based on the current revealed production and investment plans of the companies in the portfolio? (Section 4)}
			}
			
			Section 4 of this report will quantify the expected evolution of the portfolio's exposure to high-carbon and low-carbon activities in 5 years (Startyear+5) based on the current revealed production and investment plans of companies in portfolio with business activities in the fossil fuel, power, and automotive sectors. The section will show the portfolio's expected future technology mix in each sector compared to the expected future technology mix of both the aggregated investment portfolio of the peer group included in this analysis and the market aligned to a ScenarioValue. Additionally the regional exposure to coal mining activities shall also be displayed. 
			
			\item{\textbf{What is driving the results? (Section 5)}}
			
			Section 5 will provide background on the securities and companies driving the results presented in the previous sections, including additional analysis on individual companies' profiles. 
			
			\textit{For clarity, background information outlining the context of scenario analysis, the scenarios and modelling and transition risk is provided at the end of the report (Section 6).}

	\begin{multicols}{2}
		There are a number of sectors for which no substitutable lower carbon technologies exist at scale on the market or there is insufficient asset level or scenario data. This is relevant to the steel, cement, shipping and air transport sectors. For these sectors, an analysis of the required changes in emissions intensity is conducted. 
	
		For these sectors, decarbonisation efforts are confined to increasing efficiency in production and use, as well as investment in research and development in the next 5-10 years, in order to bring CO\textsubscript{2}-neutral alternatives to market maturity in the medium term. As a result, both the scenarios and the data are relatively imprecise.
	
		The figures presented below are based on external CO\textsubscript{2} intensity estimates, based on a publicly available emissions estimation model developed by 2Dii together with the consulting company Ernst \& Young. For shipping, an external CO\textsubscript{2} rating model developed by Rightship and the Carbon War Room has been used. A rating of A is indicative of best in class ship efficiency and G worst in class. Since this model is estimated externally and top-down, it is associated with some uncertainties. The results should therefore be considered as estimates, in contrast to the scenario analysis of the energy, electricity and automotive sectors. More information can be found in Section 6.

		\textbf{The figure below shows the estimated exposure in Startyear+5 to high-carbon and low-carbon technologies for the fossil fuels, power, and automotive sector, in both the corporate bond and equity portfolios. }
		
		The results are a function both of the starting point of the exposure (Section 2) and the evolution of the exposure over time (Section 3) based on current revealed investment and production plans for all technologies. The results show the relative exposure of the portfolios across asset classes and technologies / fuels. The results are compared to the aligned market fuel mix under a ScenarioValue transition in Startyear+5. 
		
		As highlighted previously, the analysis does not include assumptions around changes in portfolio composition. Rather, it is limited to how the portfolio's  exposure to high-carbon and low-carbon technologies is set to change over time as a function of changes in company exposures, independent of portfolio composition changes. The results help contextualize the share of the sectoral exposure in Startyear+5 exposed to transition risks in terms of the share of activities that can be classified as either high-carbon or low-carbon. Given the marginal nature of renewable activities across oil and gas companies, this share has not been considered in the analysis, although it may over time represent a growing share.

		\textbf{The objective of this section is to provide insight into the specific companies driving the results presented in the previous sections.}
		
		The following pages will show results for individual companies in the fossil fuel, power, and automotive sectors. The analytics provided show just one piece of information related to potential scenario analysis of companies and their contribution to a portfolio's performance. A range of additional indicators could be considered that go beyond the scope of this particular report. The indicators presented here should not be considered as investment recommendations, but rather as information about the companies driving the results of the portfolio scenario analysis. Section 6 provides further detail on the data sources informing this section. 
		
		As part of a partnership with a range of technical experts, 2Dii is currently developing a company scenario analysis report mirroring the portfolio reports presented here, designed to be made freely available and provide a more comprehensive and holistic picture of a company's positioning relative to a decarbonization scenario. This infrastructure can be used to inform future scenario analysis and actions and will be launched in the second half of 2018. The analytics in this report thus only show a snapshot of the type of data that can be explored. 
		
		The following will briefly summarize the type of data that is shown for each sector that is present in the portfolio. 
		
		\textbf{Oil and gas.} For oil and gas production, three types of indicators are shown. 
		
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item The first indicator is the total planned change in production of oil and gas companies over the next 5 years, based on the currently revealed production plans in the asset-level databases. The graphs on the next page show the largest companies by amount of oil or gas production allocated to the corporate bond and equity portfolios in Startyear; these companies have the most influence on the portfolio's alignment results for the fossil fuels sector. For each asset class and technology, the results are shown relative to the portfolio's targeted total change in production during the 5 year period under the ScenarioValue (green bar). It should be noted that the figures provided are based on current estimated production and evolution of the existing asset base. Mergers, acquisitions, and increases in capital expenditure relative to baselines may of course lead to changes in these trends over time. 
			\item The second indicator builds on analysis conducted by the Carbon Tracker Initiative in partnership with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI). This indicator takes a more long-term view and analyses the alignment of companies with a 2\degree C carbon budget from the perspective of the cost structure of their oil and gas assets. This indicator differs from the first in terms of the time horizon and the underlying allocation rules that allocate macro scenarios to microeconomic actors. More information on the methodology and the approach can be found at http://www.2degreeseparation.com/. This indicator can only be used to analyze the listed equity portfolio, as data is unavailable for corporate bond securities. 
			\item The third indicator shows the breakdown of oil assets of individual companies by type of oil (e.g., conventional, tar sands, etc.). Wood Mackenzie (2018) proposes that while shifting away from high-carbon fuels towards low carbon is necessary as an overall trend, within the oil and gas industry, shifting away from particular extraction methods is a transitional alternative. This report does not comment on the emissions by extraction type, however data is available on this. Investors need to look beyond resource themes and review the variations in upstream emissions intensity to see how companies can reduce their carbon footprints. Even assets of the same theme can have significantly different emissions intensity based upon maturity, location and other unique factors.
		\end{enumerate}
			
		\textbf{Power and automotive sectors.} For the power and automotive sectors, the company level information focuses on the technology mix of the utilities and automotive manufacturers in the corporate bond and equity portfolios, informing in particular the results for Section 4. Additional information on the build out plans of these companies and the changes over time can be provided upon request.

		\textbf{Physical climate risks have been identified by financial regulators and insurance companies as a major financial risk to portfolios.}
		
		The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a global network consisting of 19 central banks and supervisors, argues for immediate action:
		
		\textit{``Exact pathways may be uncertain but it is foreseeable that financial risks will crystallize in some form through either the physical or transition channel, or some combination of them both. And while the financial risks may be realized in full over extended time horizon, the risks call for action in the short-term to reduce impact in the long-term.”}
		
		Scenario analysis regarding physical climate risks also constitutes one of the core recommendations of the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
		
		\textbf{Physical risks can impact companies' cash flows and by extension the prices of financial securities and value of financial portfolios through three channels:}
		
		\textbf{Direct effects} are those effects by which physical risks directly impact the operational and / or production capacity of a company. Direct effects are usually measured at the point of production (e.g. power plant, factory, steel plant, etc.). However, they could also arise if the headquarters of a company are impacted, thus inhibiting a company’s ability to manage and control remote production processes. 
		
		\textbf{Market effects} are indirect effects by which a company’s markets are impacted by direct physical risks, thus inhibiting the company’s ability to sell into these markets. Market effects may arise as a result of damages to transport infrastructure inhibiting supply (e.g. damages to ports, electricity transmission lines, etc.) or consumers purchasing power inhibiting demand (e.g. a hurricane damaging coastal communities).
		
		\textbf{Domino effects} are knock-on effects from market effects or other factors that inhibit cash flows. These could lead to a diversion of resources to damaged communities that were originally earmarked for purposes benefitting the company. They could also lead to economic knock-on effects where a collapse in demand in one market impacts a second market that the company has significant exposure to. In that vein, transition risks can be considered ‘domino effects’ as climate policy accelerates in response to extreme weather events. 
		
		\textbf{Each of these risks can impact cash flows in one of two ways:}
		
		Physical risks can create \textbf{one-off impacts} after which productive capacities and markets recover. These types of risks can manifest themselves through losses in cash flows in the short-term as well as through ‘recovery costs’ and additional adaptation costs;
		
		Alternatively, physical risks can give rise to \textbf{permanent impacts} on cash flows with no recovery or adaptation costs, but more long-term impacts in terms of lost cash flows.
		
		\textbf{Given the relatively nascent nature of physical climate risk modeling, the scenario analysis in this report will be limited to an `exposure’ perspective based exclusively on direct effects.}

		\textbf{Climate-related physical risks cut across a range of traditional natural disaster categories (EM-DAT 2016):}
		
		\textbf{Climatological risks} arise from hazards related to long-lived, meso- to macro-scale atmospheric processes ranging from intra-seasonal to multi-decadal climate variability. Notable examples are droughts and wildfires. Climatological risks – as the name suggests – are likely to increase significantly in the medium- to long-term under global warming.
		
		\textbf{Meteorological risks} arise from hazards caused by short-lived, micro- to meso-scale extreme weather and atmospheric conditions that last from minutes to days (e.g. storms, hurricanes). These events are similarly likely to intensify over time, with some evidence that the frequency and severity of hurricanes is likely to accelerate as a result of global warming.
		
		\textbf{Hydrological risks} arise from hazards caused by the occurrence, movement, and distribution of surface and subsurface freshwater and saltwater (e.g. floods). Sea level rise resulting from glacier melting has been noticeable over the past two decades and is likely to increase over time.
		
		\textbf{Geophysical risks} arise from hazards originating from solid earth. This term is used interchangeably with the term geological hazard. Examples include earthquakes or tsunamis. There is some academic literature suggesting that the impacts of climate change increase seismic activity (Sauber and Ruppert 2008).
		
		\textbf{Biological risks} arise from hazards caused by exposure to living organisms and the toxic substances (e.g. venom, mold) or vector-borne diseases that they may carry. Changes in climate are likely to reduce biodiversity, which may be critical for e.g. agricultural activities.
		
		In this scenario analysis report, the focus will be on three types of physical climate risks across the areas described above: i) droughts, ii) floods, and iii) wildfires.

		\textbf{The figures below show the percent exposure to water stress of thermal power plants in the fixed income and listed equity portfolios, based on the WRI Aqueduct risk maps in 2020 and 2040.}
		
		Water stress as a physical risk is a particular challenge for thermal power plants, which are labelled here as coal, oil, nuclear, and gas power plants \textit{(note: technically, solar thermal and geothermal power plants also fall in this category, though they operate differently relative to water stress)}. Water stress refers to the likelihood of water shortages in comparison to the current availability. This is only relevant for thermal power plants that by design require water for operations such as cooling or steam generation. 
		
		The charts show, for each asset class, the current asset base exposure to water stress in 2020 and 2040, as well as the distribution of that exposure across individual bonds in the relevant portfolio in 2020 only. Risk levels are defined in four categories: 'extremely high and arid' refers to water stress with projected ratios of water withdrawal to supply exceeding 80\%, 'high' refers to projected ratios from 40-80\%, 'middle-low' refers to projected ratios from 0-40\%, while 'unknown' refers to assets that could not be linked to a risk category.

	\begin{multicols}{2}
		\textbf{The analytics below summarize the exposure of the portfolios’ power assets, oil and gas assets, and coal mining assets to flood and wildfire risk.} 
		
		The flood risk analytics build on an EU-developed global flood risk map that classifies flood risk as 1 in 10, 1 in 20, 1 in 100, 1 in 200, or 1 in 500. The analysis here uses the 1 in 100 scenario, assuming an increased likelihood of flood events as global temperature rises. 
		
		The actual degree of `flood risk’ is a function of the specific nature of the asset and its position. Thus, a 2 meter flood may be material for some types of assets and not for others. As a result, the actual risk classification – being generic – may not be reflective of the actual underlying risk to any individual asset. As such, the classification seeks merely to represent the exposure of the portfolios’ assets to various flood outcomes.
		
		The wildfire risk analytics build on the UN Environment global wildfire risk map. Similar to floods, wildfires will not constitute an equal ‘threat’ to all types of assets, varying in prominence as a function of specific characteristics of the assets. 
		
		Risk levels are defined in three categories: risk, no risk, and unknown. In the flood charts, `risk' refers to any flood height above 0 meters, `no risk' refers to no expected flooding, and 'unknown' indicates there is no link to flood height figures. In the wildfire charts, `risk' refers to an event density of at least 1 day per, `no risk' indicates no expected wildfire risk, and 'unknown' refers to assets that could not be linked to event density figures.

		\textbf{Background.} In June 2017, the G20 Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommended that financial institutions perform scenario analysis on their portfolios to assess financial risks related to climate change. The TCFD grouped climate-related risks into two categories: physical and transition risks. Transition risks are risks generated by the policy, technology, market, and regulatory changes likely to accompany the transition to a low carbon economy.
		
		%UNPRI_TextS
		\textbf{PRI. }The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is the world's largest investor network on responsible investment, with around 2000 asset owner and asset manager signatories. 
		
		PRI works to understand the investment implications of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and to support its international network of investor signatories in incorporating these factors into their investment and ownership decisions. Climate change is the highest priority ESG issue facing investors. The PRI is working to help investors protect portfolios from risks and to expose them to opportunities in the shift to a low-carbon global economy. 
		%UNPRI_TextE
		
		\textbf{Goal.} The goal of the scenario analysis is to assess investors' exposure to transition risk, individually and as a whole, based on their estimated current and future exposure to high-carbon and low-carbon activities. This report provides the results of the analysis for a single portfolio.
		
		\textbf{Approach.} The key elements of the analysis are:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{\textit{Current and planned production and investment trends.} Current and planned production (for the fossil fuel and automotive sector) and current installed capacity as well as new capacity additions (for the power sector) for the next 5 years were sourced from commercial business intelligence databases. These data providers collect forward-looking production and capacity data at the physical asset level, including barrels of oil by field, cars by model and factory, and new capacity by power plant. 2Dii maps this data to their immediate owners and parent company to generate a company's aggregate `current production profile' for each technology. These production plans are linked to the financial securities (equity and corporate bond) issued by the company. The asset-level data used for this analysis was retrieved from data providers during the first half of 2017. See the `Important Considerations and Limitations' section at the end of the report for notes on interpreting power sector capacity data.}
			
			\item{\textit{Allocating the production of physical assets to financial assets.} Based on the share of total equity or debt held in a portfolio, the model allocates a portion of each corporate issuer's current production plans for each technology to the portfolio. Aggregated over all companies to the portfolio level, this is the portfolio's `current production profile' for a technology. This also defines the investor's current `exposure' to each technology.}
			
			\item{\textit{From macro-level scenarios to micro-level targets. }To calculate production levels consistent with a climate scenario such as the IEA sustainable development scenario, the model uses a `fair share' principle that applies the changes specified by the scenario for a given technology and region equally across all owners of physical assets in that technology's sector in the given region. This creates a set of alternative, forward-looking production and capacity profiles consistent with the scenario for each company and technology. These alternative profiles are then aggregated to the portfolio level to create the portfolio's `target production profile' under the scenario. This profile is used to determine the investor's `target exposure' to a technology under the scenario. The `target exposure' does not assume any change in the composition of the portfolio: it models the changes in production and investment plans that are required across the different companies held in the portfolio in order to match the technology deployment described in the scenario.} 
			
			\item{\textit{Emissions intensity analysis.} For sectors where there is not sufficient data available either regarding the assets or the scenarios and where there are no commerically suitable replacements, one solution is to analyse required changes in emissions intensity. For these sectors, decarbonisation efforts will be confined to increasing efficiency in production and use, as well as investment in research and 	development in the next 5-10 years, in order to bring CO\textsubscript{2}-neutral alternatives to market maturity in the medium term. As a result, both the scenarios and the data are relatively imprecise.}
			
		\end{itemize}
		
		\textbf{Results of the scenario analysis.} The portfolio's `target profile' under the scenario can be compared to the portfolio's currently revealed production and investment plans for each technology to derive the exposure to transition risk as well as the extent to which the portfolio is projected to increase or decrease alignment with the ScenarioValue over the next 5 years.

		\textbf{Assessing Alignment with a ScenarioValue Transition Pathway. }This analysis assesses the level of alignment with a ScenarioValue transition pathway, using two references:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{\textit{The portfolio under a ScenarioValue transition.} This is the portfolio's target production profile `under the ScenarioValue': the changes required in the production profile of the companies held in the portfolio, in order to meet the target, based on the above-described methodology. Since the securities held and their weight in the portfolio are identical for the portfolio and its alternative versions, comparing them shows how aligned or misaligned the current production profiles of companies held in the portfolio are with each scenario.}
			
			\item{\textit{The ScenarioValue market. }This is the target production profile of the market under the ScenarioValue. The same principle as described above is applied to an aligned portfolio: the listed equity market as a whole, or the corporate bond market as a whole. Since the securities and their weight in the market portfolio differ from those in the portfolio, this comparison highlights `idiosyncratic' alignment or misalignment. In other words, it shows how the current composition of the portfolio affects the alignment with the different scenarios, when the first reference only stresses the changes requested from the companies.}
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		The alignment or misalignment of a portfolio's production and exposure to each technology relative to a scenario is one way to better understand an investor's exposure to energy transition risk. If policy, technology, market, or regulatory changes occur to bring the global real economy in line with the ScenarioValue, misalignment in a given technology would likely change the financial returns associated with those underlying physical assets. However, this analysis only assesses one dimension of energy transition risks: the assets at risk in the real economy. It does not take into account the financial resilience of the company to those changes and its capacity to adapt, which would require further financial analysis.
		
		\textbf{Scenarios.} This scenario analysis is based on scenarios developed by the IEA. The Beyond 2 degrees scenario (B2DS) focuses on achieving sustainable growth while limiting temperature rise to below 2\degree\ C. The Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) is a move towards a holistic approach to sustainability rather than focussing solely on climate change. In addition to the SDS, the IEA also defines the New Policies Scenario (NPS) and Current Policies Scenario (CPS): other technology roadmaps that correspond to a 50\% probability of maximum 4\degree C and 6\degree C warming, respectively. The SDS (also referred as the `2\degree\ scenario'), NPS (`4\degree\ scenario'), and CPS (`6\degree\ scenario') all provide forward-looking projections with enough regional detail to perform scenario analysis for 11 technologies in 3 sectors.
		
		The model uses the following indicators from the International Energy Agency scenario against which the portfolio is compared:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Electric capacity by fuel expressed in MW (e.g. renewables, coal, gas, oil, hydropower, nuclear);}
			\item{Oil production expressed in barrels of oil / year;}
			\item{Gas production expressed in m\textsuperscript{3} / year;}
			\item{Coal produced expressed in tonnes / year;}
			\item{GHG emissions pathways in a sample of additional sectors (e.g. aviation, shipping, cement, steel).}
		\end{itemize}
		
		 
		\textbf{Asset Level Data.} The Asset Level data is sourced from the following data providers: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{GlobalData (Power plant data, including plants classified as active, announced, financed, partially active, permitting, temporarily shutdown, under construction, under rehabilitation and modernization, and Oil and Gas production data and forecasts until Startyear-Startyear+5, as well as coal mining data); }
			\item{WardsAuto (light passenger duty vehicles, including BAU production forecasts Startyear-Startyear+5); }
			\item{Bloomberg (financial data);}
			\item{S\&P Cross-Reference Services (database matching securities to parents);}
			\item{Morningstar (database on funds). }
			
		\end{itemize}
		
		\textbf{Model Parameters.} The scenario analysis presented here reflects a selection of parameter inputs. More details to these parameters and the different implications of the specification of these can be found at www.transitionmonitor.com/backgroundinformation.

	\HeaderDouble{IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS}{WHEN INTERPRETING THESE RESULTS }
	
	\begin{multicols}{2}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{\textit{Stringency of scenarios.} The use of a given scenario (B2DS, SDS, NPS, CPS) does not constitute an assumption that this scenario is more likely to prevail than others. Similarly, the choice of IEA scenarios should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the underlying assumptions by 2Dii. The IEA historically has assumed significant amounts of nuclear power and carbon capture and storage in their scenarios, an assumption that is debated within the energy-climate scientific community. In addition, the international community has accelerated their global target from the 2\degree C goal to well below 2\degree C and towards 1.5\degree C. It is important to highlight that each investor can and may want to take an individual view on the likely decarbonization scenario that may or may not relate to the scenarios modelled by the International Energy Agency.}
			
			\item{\textit{A snapshot rather than forecasts.} The forward-looking production data is based on current `revealed' plans from companies, and is subject to change. The estimates should thus not be interpreted as forecasts, but rather as the current plans of companies as estimated from various sources of information by industry-specific business intelligence experts. Given the 5 year time horizon, it is likely that these plans will change in some way over time. Similarly, investors are highly likely to alter the composition of their portfolio over time. Corporate bond maturity is usually around 3-7 years. The average holding period of a stock by a fund manager is 20 months on average. However, this analysis seeks to be a point in time assessment of future exposures under current conditions.}
			
			\item{\textit{Power sector projections.} Distinct from the production data for the fossil fuel and automotive sectors, capacity data for the power sector does not include information on planned retirements. It should therefore be interpreted as a measure of currently locked-in capacity and not as a forecast of future capacity. Retirements are not included for several reasons: First, the availability of planned retirement data is highly variable across jurisdictions and regions, to the extent that including no retirement information was deemed more representative of industry capacity than including partial data. Second, in contrast to the fossil fuel sector where oil wells, gas fields, and coal mines cease production when their resource runs out, it is possible for power plants to be announced as retired or even be retired and then resume production. Given the higher level of uncertainty around planned retirements, they are not included in the power sector projections used for this analysis, and capacity projections should thus be interpreted as the potential maximum `lock-in' from current infrastructure. For technologies projected to decline under the ScenarioValue, the gap between current capacity projections and capacity consistent with the ScenarioValue should be seen as an estimate of the capacity that would need to be retired to be in alignment with the ScenarioValue.} 
			
			\item{\textit{Ability to capture SRI strategies. }The model takes a diversified `market portfolio' as a basis, focusing on key technologies reflected in the IEA roadmaps. By extension, thematic portfolios invested in breakthrough technologies and / or SRI portfolios with a range of environmental, social, and governmental considerations may not value these elements.}

		\textbf{What are transition risks?} Transition risks can be broadly defined as economic and financial risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. The international community has defined a mandate to limit the man-made contribution to global warming to well below 2\degree C above pre-industrial levels. According to best available science, achieving this objective requires decarbonizing the economy in the course of this century. This decarbonization is set to have significant implications for high-carbon sectors, most prominent among which are the fossil fuel, power, and transport sectors, contributing the majority of global anthropogenic GHG emissions. 
		
		As the economy decarbonizes, companies that fail to properly anticipate this transition are set to be exposed to economic risks. Companies well-prepared for this transition in turn are set to capitalize from this economic opportunity. Similarly, economic risks may translate into financial risks in financial markets if these risks are not properly anticipated by financial market actors. 
		
		Crucially, the transition to a low-carbon economy is set to already have dramatic impacts in the short- and medium-term. By 2040, in only 22 years, global coal production is set to decline by 46\%, with a more accelerated decline expected in developed markets. Global coal power capacity in turn is similarly set to decline by 41\%. The production of gasoline and diesel vehicles (internal combustion engine or ICE vehicles) is set to decline by 21\%. This decline in high-carbon activity in turn will be accompanied by the commensurate deployment and growth of new technologies. Renewable power capacity and electric vehicle production in turn is set to nearly quadruple in volume by 2040. 
		
		Scenario analysis can help financial institutions assess and ultimately manage the risks and opportunities associated with the transition. In recognition of these risks, scenario analysis has been applied to date by hundreds of financial institutions as well as financial supervisors. It forms the basis of the recommendations of the FSB TCFD. The TCFD notes that ``forward-looking assessments of climate-related issues is important for investors and other stakeholders in understanding how vulnerable individual organizations are to transition and physical risks and how such vulnerabilities are or would be addressed. As a result, the Task Force believes that organizations should use scenario analysis to assess potential business, strategic, and financial implications of climate-related risks and opportunities and disclose those, as appropriate, in their annual financial filings" (TCFD Final Report, p. 33). 
		
		To clarify its scenario analysis recommendation, the Task Force explains, ``A key type of transition risk scenario is a so-called 2\degree C scenario, which lays out a pathway and an emissions trajectory consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to 2\degree C above pre-industrial levels" (TCFD Final Report, p. 35).
		
		It is this premise that forms the basis of this report, highlighting for the portfolio the current exposure to transition risks in the fossil fuel, power, and automotive sectors, the trends in the portfolio over time in these sectors relative to the 2\degree C scenario, and the expected future exposure on the basis of these trends. While these sectors do not represent all high-carbon activities and sectors, they account for both the largest share in a typical portfolio and the most significant contribution to climate change currently, as well as benefiting from well-developed scenario pathways.
		
		The report does not provide specific estimates as to the potential loss in value that may be realised in the portfolio should these risks materialize, which is obviously associated with significant uncertainty and myriad modelling assumptions. For any individual security, the potential loss may range from 0 to 100\% and may even be associated with positive returns, depending on the adaptive capacity of the company, the anticipation of the trend by financial markets, and the nature of a potential repricing. It is the proper anticipation of these risks that minimizes the loss that this report seeks to contribute to.

		The analysis for the power portfolio builds on the forward-looking projections of capacity additions by fuel over the next 5 years, as sourced from business intelligence data provider GlobalData. The five year time horizon is a function of the typical investment planning horizon of power capacity additions, recognizing that planning horizons for specific investments may be either longer or shorter. More long-term analysis would thus fail to identify significant further additions currently in the planning pipeline of companies. Excluded from the company information charts are the planned power capacity additions by companies outside of the power sector (e.g. IT companies building wind parks to power their data centers). The evolution of the portfolio is based on the planned capacity additions by the companies behind the securities in the portfolio, weighted by their relative weight in the portfolio. 
		
		It is important to note that data on announced or otherwise officially planned retirements of power assets is not considered in the analysis presented here. This is intentional, given both a dearth of related data, as well as the desire to show the required retirements. For technologies projected to decline under the ScenarioValue, the gap between current capacity projections and capacity consistent with the ScenarioValue should be seen as an estimate of the capacity that would need to be retired to be in alignment with the ScenarioValue. 
		
		As outlined above, the scenarios are based on the global trends, scaled to the portfolio based on the `fair share' approach, where the trend in the macro scenario is translated into a micro target based on the market share of the portfolio. For the power sector, this approach may of course fail to capture changes in market share across asset classes and actors, notably with the rise of household renewable power capacity (e.g. rooftop solar), set to change the power market. While this trend implies that in practice companies are likely to lose market share, this trend is intentionally not internalized in the analysis, in order to document the potential loss of market share under a ScenarioValue - and by extension the potential accumulating transition risk.
		
		In a 2\degree C or below scenario, the power sector will decarbonize over the long-term in a shift from fossil fuel-based to renewable energy production. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that in a 2\degree C scenario:
		
		``Electricity supply worldwide is set to diversify and decarbonise, with low-carbon generation overtaking coal before 2020. Coal-fired power's share of generation is projected to fall from above 40\% now to 28\% in 2040. By then, wind, solar and bioenergy-based renewables combined increase their market share from 6\% to 20\%" (IEA World Energy Outlook 2016, p. 241).
		
		The mix of technologies will vary greatly based on the scenario. Coal-based power generation will increase under current trends but decreases in a 2\degree C scenario. Wind and solar would grow more rapidly in a 2\degree C Scenario.
		
		Equity and corporate bond investors are exposed to these trends through the financial instruments issued by power companies. An estimated 28\% of power generation assets are owned by publicly traded companies and 19\% of assets are owned by listed state entities, for example municipal bond issuers (see figure below).

	\section*{} % EMISSIONS INTENSITY ANALYSIS
	\HeaderSingle{EMISSIONS INTENSITY ANALYSIS}
	
		\begin{multicols}{2}
			
			
			\textbf{Methodology}
			
			For the emissions intensity analysis an emission factor for each plant is calculated in units per production. This is then aggregated to the portfolio by weighting by the weight of the company within the portfolio. The scenario data is then scaled to this starting point and the trajectory for emissions reduction is shown for the next five years. 
			
			These results can serve as a starting point for discussions with steel, cement, aviation and shipping companies regarding their strategies for achieving the trajectory for each sector. 
			
				
			\textbf{Scenarios} 
			
			The emissions intensity reduction pathway is based on the scenarios presented in the Energy Technology Perspectives 2017. The expected production and emissions for the steel, cement and aviation sectors are provided at a regional level. The pathways presented in this sector follow the 2\degree\ C scenario. The shipping sector does not have sufficient data to complete this, and therefore the portfolio is compared to market.
			
			
			\textbf{Steel} 
			
			After chemicals, steel production is the second largest energy consumer among industrial sectors and the most carbon-intensive sector. The deployment of 	electric arc furnaces is key to reducing emissions (even if this technology remains carbon-emitting). The calculation of an emissions factor for each steel plant is based on the technology deloyed, the fuel used, and the regional factors for emissions from the electricity grid and fuel consumption as relevant. Additionally this is then multiplied by the plant capacity and a regionally selected capacity factor. These factors are sourced from the OECD data bases and the World Steel Association.  
			
 			\textbf{Cement}
 			
			Cement production is another high emitting sector, with concrete production expected to account for 5\% of the world's man made emissions (Cement Sustainability Initiative). This comes primarily in the production from three sources, the calcination process, thermal energy use and electricity use. The emissions factor is calculated from regional factors applied to each plant. The majority of the data for this comes from the Cement Sustainability Initiative. 
			
			\textbf{Aviation}
			
			To estimate the current CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from aircraft fleets assumptions regarding aircraft utilization rates were made. The emissions have been estimated for each company on a per passenger kilometer basis; an equivalent for aircraft used for freight only has been calculated. There is a high level of uncertainty in this methodology.
			
			\textbf{Shipping}
			
			The best practice for shipping sustainability assessments is the  Carbon Efficiency Level, developed by Carbon War Room and Rightship. Each vessel is rated from A to G, where A is the most efficient ships in each ship category (eg. oil tanker, cargo, etc.), allowing for a common point of comparison. The ranking is dynamically calculated to account for annual improvements in efficiency and variations in the mean, so that ``A" ships always represent the top 10\% (measured in terms of CO\textsubscript{2} intensity). As there is no scenario data available the shipping results for the portfolio are compared to the market.

		\textbf{WWF project 2016-2019: aligning European asset owners’ portfolios with the Paris Agreement }
		
		This well below 2\degree C scenario analysis was undertaken in the context of a WWF project that aims to align asset owners’ investment portfolios with the Paris Agreement. WWF is asking the largest European asset owners in 11 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the UK) to undertake this analysis for their public equity and corporate bond portfolios.
		
		WWF is not the author of the well below 2\degree C scenario analysis, but is using its findings as part of a constructive dialogue with asset owners. This dialogue focuses on ways to identify and better address climate-related financial risk and opportunities. Ultimately, WWF’s objective for this engagement with asset owners is to achieve Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement: ``Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient development”.
		
		WWF requests from the asset owner that selected findings (for fossil fuel extraction and renewable/coal power) of this analysis can be included in a public research report. No findings will be included without the explicit and written consent from asset owners, except if the asset owner publicly discloses public equity and/or corporate bond holding data.
		
		
		\textbf{Recommendations to asset owners}
		
		WWF has published a range of guides for asset owners, containing recommendations on how they can address climate-related drivers of risk and opportunities – and align their investment portfolios with the Paris Agreement. These include:
		
		\begin{itemize}
				\item \hyperlink{http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/wwf\_climate\_guide\_to\_asset\_owners\_summary\_vlr\_with\_links\_update\_april\_18.pdf}{15 topline recommendations on climate change}, which summarise the more detailed versions from the \hyperlink{http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/wwf\_climate\_guide\_to\_asset\_owners\_\_\_full\_version\_mr\_linked\_update\_april\_18.pdf}{full WWF Climate Guide to Asset Owners}.
			
			\item Sectoral recommendations on how asset owners can address \hyperlink{http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/3717\_WWF\_Asset\_Owner\_Guide\_on\_Coal\_Mining\_06\_mr.pdf}{coal mining} companies and \hyperlink{http://d2ouvy59p0dg6k.cloudfront.net/downloads/3717\_WWF\_Asset\_Owner\_Guide\_on\_Coal\_and\_Renewable\_electric\_power\_utilities\_06\_mr.pdf}{electric power companies} that own coal plants.
			
			\item In addition, WWF is working on an asset owner guide for the oil and gas sector and briefings for specific coal-heavy electric power companies.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
		\textbf{A valuable tool to inform financial decision-making}
		
		In the view of WWF, the model framework used for this well below 2\degree scenario analysis is a valuable tool to inform financial decision-making. As any tool, this model framework is developed for a specific purpose and scope, and explores a new field of analysis. When considering the findings of this well below 2\degree C analysis, the following needs to be borne in mind:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The model currently covers public equity and corporate bonds. WWF invites asset owners to discuss and develop approaches to assess the climate alignment for other asset classes, notably sovereign fixed income and alternative asset classes (e.g. renewable energy infrastructure).
			
			\item The model is forward-looking in the sense that it takes into account company investment plans to the degree such information can be gathered or is available today. The time horizon is limited to 2023 because current data on company plans do not allow meaningful projections beyond 5 years. The required speed and scale of the decarbonisation accelerates beyond 2023 under Paris aligned climate scenarios, implying that asset owners will need to take further action if they wish to remain aligned beyond that point in time.
		\end{itemize}
	
		\textbf{A note on the use of climate scenarios}
		
		The model framework is scenario neutral, i.e. it is not restricted for use only with the IEA Beyond 2\degree C Scenario (B2DS). It is therefore possible to measure portfolio alignment against any type of scenario that provides sufficient coverage and granularity. To be able to do so, some central assumptions have been made on portfolio development. However, currently only the IEA scenarios offer sufficient granularity in terms of technology production/capacity breakdown of climate-relevant sectors.  
		
		For this project, WWF has opted for the IEA B2DS to define the climate benchmark against which to assess asset owners’ portfolios. The B2DS is consistent with a 50\% chance of limiting average future temperature increases to 1.75\degree C, and provides the greatest likelihood amongst IEA scenarios to respect the well below 2\degree C target of the Paris Agreement. 
		
		It is important to keep in mind that the IEA scenarios (like any scenario) are designed for certain purposes and based on numerous indicators and technology assumptions. These may not all hold true, and hence any scenario can be challenged. Several stakeholders, including WWF, do not fully agree with the IEA on e.g. the conservative assumptions on renewable energy development; or (as with most scenarios) the aggressive assumptions on the deployment of CCS (particularly for the power sector) and nuclear power.
		
		Scenarios remain the best available basis for forward-looking analysis, however, and should be considered to present a possible way to realize a climate compatible transition based on the most up to date knowledge and research results. WWF recommends asset owners to ask research institutions, including the IEA, to develop more ambitious and sufficiently granular scenarios with high probabilities to limit global warming to 1.5\degree C.
		
		WWF remains at the disposal of asset owners to provide further explanations about the project’s approach, its body of recommendations, and its views on the assessment model and IEA scenarios.
